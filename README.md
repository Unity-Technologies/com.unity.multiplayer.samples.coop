## Co-op multiplayer RPG and utilities built with Unity Netcode for GameObjects

Boss Room is a fully functional co-op multiplayer RPG made with Unity Netcode. It is an educational sample designed to showcase typical netcode [patterns](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/learn/bossroom/bossroom-actions/index.html) that are frequently featured in similar multiplayer games.


__PLEASE NOTE__:
Boss Room is compatible with the latest Unity Long Term Support (LTS) editor version, currently [2021 LTS](https://unity.com/releases/2021-lts). Please include standalone support for Windows/Mac in your installation. <br>

**Boss Room has been developed and tested on the following platforms:**
- Windows
- Mac
- iOS
- Android <br>

**Boss Room's min spec devices are:**
- iPhone 6S
- Samsung Galaxy J2 Core <br>

## Boss Room Overview

Boss Room is designed to be used in its entirety to help you explore the concepts and patterns behind a multiplayer game flow; such as character abilities, casting animations to hide latency, replicated objects, RPCs, and integration with the [Relay](https://unity.com/products/relay), [Lobby](https://unity.com/products/lobby), and [Authentication](https://unity.com/products/authentication) services.

You can use the project as a reference starting point for your own Unity game or use elements individually.

This repository also contains a [Utilities](Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop) package, containing reusable sample scripts. You can install it using the following manifest file entry:

`"com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop": "https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop.git?path=/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop",
`.

## Getting the project
### Direct download
 - You can download the latest version of Boss Room from our [Releases](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop/releases) page. 
 - __Alternatively:__ click the green `Code` button and then select the 'Download Zip' option.  Please note that this will download the branch that you are currently viewing on Github.  
 - __Windows users:__ Using Windows' built-in extraction tool may generate an "Error 0x80010135: Path too long" error window which can invalidate the extraction process. A workaround for this is to shorten the zip file to a single character (eg. "c.zip") and move it to the shortest path on your computer (most often right at C:\\) and retry. If that solution fails, another workaround is to extract the downloaded zip file using [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).


### Installing Git LFS to clone locally

Boss Room uses Git Large Files Support (LFS) to handle all large assets required locally. See [Git LFS installation options](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) for Windows and Mac instructions. This step is only needed if cloning locally. You can also just download the project which will already include large files.

## Registering the project with Unity Gaming Services (UGS)

Boss Room leverages several services from UGS to facilitate connectivity between players. To use these services inside your project, you must [create an organization](https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/articles/208592876-How-do-I-create-a-new-Organization-) inside the Unity Dashboard, and enable the [Relay](https://docs.unity.com/relay/get-started.html) and [Lobby](https://docs.unity.com/lobby/game-lobby-sample.html) services. Otherwise, you can still use Boss Room without UGS.

## Opening the project for the first time

Once you have downloaded the project, follow the steps below to get up and running:
 - Check that you have installed the most recent [LTS editor version](https://unity.com/releases/2021-lts).
 	- Include standalone support for Windows/Mac in your installation. 
 - Add the project to the _Unity Hub_ by clicking on the **Add** button and pointing it to the root folder of the downloaded project.
 	- __Please note :__ the first time you open the project Unity will import all assets, which will take longer than usual.

 - Hit the **Play** button. You can then host a new game or join an existing one using the in-game UI.

  ------------------------------------------

## Exploring the project
BossRoom is an eight-player co-op RPG game experience, where players collaborate to fight imps, and then a boss. Players can select between classes that each have skills with didactically interesting networking characteristics. Control model is click-to-move, with skills triggered by a mouse button or hotkey.

One of the eight clients acts as the host/server. That client will use a compositional approach so that its entities have both server and client components.

- The game is server-authoritative, with latency-masking animations. 
- Position updates are carried out through NetworkTransform that sync position and rotation. 

Code is organized in domain-based assemblies. See the [Boss Room architecture documentation](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/learn/bossroom/bossroom-architecture) file for more details.
  
## Testing multiplayer

In order to see the multiplayer functionality in action we can either run multiple instances of the game locally on your computer - using either ParrelSync or builds - or choose to connect to a friend over the internet. See [how to test](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/tutorials/testing/testing_locally) for more info.

---------------
**Local multiplayer setup**

First, build an executable by clicking **'File/Build Settings'** in the menu bar, and then click **'Build'**.<br>  
![](Documentation/Images/BuildProject.png)

Once the build has completed you can launch several instances of the built executable in order to both host and join a game. When using several instances locally, you will have to set different profiles for each instance for authentication purposes, by using the **'Change Profile'** button. <br>  
> __Mac users:__ to run multiple instances of the same app, you need to use the command line.  Run `open -n BossRoom.app`

---------------
**Multiplayer over Internet**

To play over internet, first build an executable that is shared between all players - as above.

It is possible to connect between multiple instances of the same executable OR between executables and the editor that produced it.

Running the game over internet currently requires setting up a relay. 
  
  
 **Relay Setup**
 
- Boss Room provides an integration with [Unity Relay](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/relay/relay). You can find our Unity Relay setup guide [here](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/relay/relay)

- Alternatively you can use Port Forwarding. The https://portforward.com/ site has guides on how to enable port forwarding on a huge number of routers.
- Boss Room uses `UDP` and needs a `9998` external port to be open. 
- Make sure your host's address listens on 0.0.0.0 (127.0.0.1 is for local development only).
