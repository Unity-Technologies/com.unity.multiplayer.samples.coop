    /// - keep running until somebody explicitly calls Shutdown() (this is used by Actions with indeterminate durations; set m_AutoShutdownTime to -1)
    /// - automatically call Shutdown() after a fixed amount of time (set m_AutoShutdownTime to the number of seconds)
    ///
    /// Note that whichever mode is used, Shutdown() may be called prematurely by whoever owns this graphic
    /// in the case of aborted actions.

    /// to let the last remaining particles finish rendering. Shutdown() turns off particles,
    /// and then self-destructs after the particles are all gone. ParticleSystems can technically
    /// self-destruct on their own after being stopped: see the "Stop Action" field in the
    /// ParticleSystem's inspector. But this script also acts as a way to self-destruct non-particle
    /// graphics, and if you're implementing object pooling (for improved mobile performance), this
    /// class can be refactored to move itself into an object pool instead of self-destructing.
