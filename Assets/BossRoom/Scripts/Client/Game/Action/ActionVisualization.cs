        /// What is Action Anticipation and what problem does it solve? In short, it lets Actions run logic the moment the input event that triggers them
        /// is detected on the local client. The purpose of this is to help mask latency. Because this demo is server authoritative, the default behavior is
        /// to only see feedback for your input after a server-client roundtrip. Somewhere over 200ms of round-trip latency, this starts to feel oppressively sluggish.
        /// To combat this, you can play visual effects immediately. For example, MeleeActionFX plays both its weapon swing and applies a hit react to the target,
        /// without waiting to hear from the server. This can lead to discrepancies when the server doesn't think the target was hit, but on the net, will feel
        /// more responsive. 
        ///
        /// An important concept of Action Anticipation is that it is opportunistic--it doesn't make any strong guarantees. You don't get an anticipated
        /// action animation if you are already animating in some way, as one example. Another complexity is that you don't know if the server will actually
        /// let you play all the actions that you've requested--some may get thrown away, e.g. because you have too many actions in your queue. What this means
        /// is that Anticipated Actions (actions that have been constructed but not started) won't match up perfectly with actual approved delivered actions from
        /// the server. For that reason, it must always be fine to receive PlayAction and not have an anticipated action already started (this is true for playback
        /// Characters belonging to the server and other characters anyway). It also means we need to handle the case where we created an Anticipated Action, but
        /// never got a confirmation--actions like that need to eventually get discarded.
        ///
        /// Another important aspect of Anticipated Actions is that they are an "opt-in" system. You must call base.Start in your Start implementation, but other than
        /// that, if you don't have a good way to implement an Anticipation for your action, you don't have to do anything. In this case, that action will play
        /// "normally" (with visual feedback starting when the server's action broadcast reaches the client). Every action type will have its own particular set of
        /// problems to solve to sell the anticipation effect. For example, in this demo, the mage base attack (FXProjectileTargetedActionFX) just plays the attack animation
        /// anticipatively, but it could be revised to create and drive the mage bolt effect as well--leaving only damage to arrive in true server time. 
        ///
        /// How to implement your own Anticipation logic:
        ///   1. Isolate the visual feedback you want play anticipatively in a private helper method on your ActionFX, like "PlayAttackAnim". 
        ///   2. Override ActionFX.AnticipateAction. Be sure to call base.AnticipateAction, as well as play your visual logic (like PlayAttackAnim). 
        ///   3. In your Start method, be sure to call base.Start (note that this will reset the "Anticipated" field to false).
        ///   4. In Start, check if the action was Anticipated. If NOT, then play call your PlayAttackAnim method.
