    /// Without this code, the boss's helmet appears to "jiggle" a bit while the boss throws his temper-tantrum.
    /// The animation in the FBX keeps the helmet staying stationary, but it moves in-game due to animation
    /// compression and floating-point round off. Since the helmet is parented deep in the transform hierarchy,
    /// it's difficult to keep the helmet precisely still while all of its parent transforms are moving around wildly.
    ///
    /// We could get rid of the majority of the jiggle by disabling animation-compression on the FBX, but that could
    /// adversely impact performance. Since this is a special case, we deal with it via this special-case script.
