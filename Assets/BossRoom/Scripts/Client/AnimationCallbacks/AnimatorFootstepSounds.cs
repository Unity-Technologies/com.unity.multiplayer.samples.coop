    /// For this project we're using a few looped footstep sounds, choosing between them
    /// based on the animated speed. This method has good performance versus a more complicated
    /// approach, but it does have a flaw: it becomes inaccurate when the character's speed is slowed.
    /// e.g. if a slowness debuff makes you move at 75% speed, the footsteps will be slightly off because
    /// we only have sound-loops for 50% and 100%. That's not a big deal in this particular game, though.
    /// In the rare situations where animated speed is faster than 100% (due to speed buffs etc.), we
    /// currently just don't play any footsteps at all.
