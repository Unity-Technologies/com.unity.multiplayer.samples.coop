    /// whether the game-layer even wants us to join (we could fail because the server is full, or some other non network related reason), and also
    /// what BossRoomState to transition to. We do this with a Custom Named Message, which fires on the server immediately after the approval check delegate
    /// has run.
    ///
    /// Why do we need to send a client GUID? What is it? Don't we already have a clientID?
    /// ClientIDs are assigned on login. If you connect to a server, then your connection drops, and you reconnect, you get a new ClientID. This
    /// makes it awkward to get back your old character, which the server is going to hold onto for a fixed timeout. To properly reconnect and recover
    /// your character, you need a persistent identifier for your own client install. We solve that by generating a random GUID and storing it
    /// in player prefs, so it persists across sessions of the game.
