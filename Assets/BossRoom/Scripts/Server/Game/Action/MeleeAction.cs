    /// Action that represents a swing of a melee weapon. It is not explicitly targeted, but rather detects the foe that was hit with a physics check.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Q: Why do we DetectFoe twice, once in Start, once when we actually connect?
    /// A: The weapon swing doesn't happen instantaneously. We want to broadcast the action to other clients as fast as possible to minimize latency,
    ///    but this poses a conundrum. At the moment the swing starts, you don't know for sure if you've hit anybody yet. There are a few possible resolutions to this:
    ///      1. Do the DetectFoe operation once--in Start.
    ///         Pros: Simple! Only one physics cast per swing--saves on perf.
    ///         Cons: Is unfair. You can step out of the swing of an attack, but no matter how far you go, you'll still be hit. The reverse is also true--you can
    ///               "step into an attack", and it won't affect you. This will feel terrible to the attacker.
    ///      2. Do the DetectFoe operation once--in Update. Send a separate RPC to the targeted entity telling it to play its hit react.
    ///         Pros: Always shows the correct behavior. The entity that gets hit plays its hit react (if any).
    ///         Cons: You need another RPC. Adds code complexity and bandwidth. You also don't have enough information when you start visualizing the swing on
    ///               the client to do any intelligent animation handshaking. If your server->client latency is even a little uneven, your "attack" animation
    ///               won't line up correctly with the hit react, making combat look floaty and disjointed.
    ///      3. Do the DetectFoe operation twice, once in Start and once in Update.
    ///         Pros: Is fair--you do the hit-detect at the moment of the swing striking home. And will generally play the hit react on the right target.
    ///         Cons: Requires more complicated visualization logic. The initial broadcast foe can only ever be treated as a "hint". The graphics logic
    ///               needs to do its own range checking to pick the best candidate to play the hit react on.
    ///
    /// As so often happens in networked games (and games in general), there's no perfect solution--just sets of tradeoffs. For our example, we're showing option "3".
