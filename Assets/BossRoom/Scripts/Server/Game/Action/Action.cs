    /// include everything from your basic character attack, to a fancy skill like the Archer's Volley Shot, but also

    /// Initially: Start()

    /// On shutdown: End() or Cancel()
    /// After shutdown: ChainIntoNewAction()    (only if Action was blocking, and only if End() was called, not Cancel())
