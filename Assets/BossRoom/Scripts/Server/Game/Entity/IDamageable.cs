            // This is not future-proof and can cause hard-to-track-down problems, when prefabs magically inherit a new flag
            // you just added. So we have the Unused flag, which should NOT do anything, and shouldn't be selected on prefabs.
            // It's just there so that we can select all the "real" flags and not get it turned into "Everything" in the editor.
